I chose the poem "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost. Based on the content of the poem, I wanted to use words to create a forking path. It would be appropriate to animate the paths that appear line by line.

So let me first let s0-s4 equal these four paragraphs. Among them, the first three sentences mean that I am standing and watching, so there is no need for animation, just appear directly. As two paths, s3 and s4 need to be split into one word and one line mode. And they all need to appear one by one, so I set two indexes to control and frameCount to control the speed of their appearance. Then use map to control their proportion in the page.

At this time, I found that because I wanted to start from the middle, the paragraphs in s4 were too long and would appear crowded, so I used translate() to adjust the page to the upper left corner of the screen
